# Network Provenance Data

Some simple synthetic network provenance data you may want to use (Abstracted Provenance Data with Activities only). 

This data is collected by running Network-Datalog program over different network topology. They contain different attack behaviors: 
1. Normal TCP handshake. 
2. Syn-Flood Attack generated 4 times a period. 
2. Syn-Flood Attack generated 6 times a period.
